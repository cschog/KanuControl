Workflow
	1.	User Authentication:
	•	The user logs in using their username and password.
	•	Keycloak validates the credentials.
	2.	Group Retrieval:
	•	The KeycloakGroupService fetches the user’s assigned groups.
	•	The application assumes the first group as the tenant.
	3.	Schema Management:
	•	The TenantDatabaseService ensures the schema exists and applies necessary migrations.
	4.	Tenant-Aware Logic:
	•	Once the schema is ready, the application can proceed with tenant-specific operations.
